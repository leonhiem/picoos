/**
 * kernel/fs.h — everything is a file
 *
 * A minimal Plan 9-flavored device namespace: a flat table of named
 * devices, each speaking open()/close()/read()/write() over plain text.
 * No ioctl(). Reading a device produces a fresh line of text on every
 * call (there's no seek/stream position — doesn't make sense for a live
 * sensor); writing sends it a text command it parses itself.
 *
 * Deliberately global/flat rather than per-task namespaces (Plan 9's
 * mount/bind machinery) — that's solving a multi-process isolation
 * problem this single-address-space microcontroller doesn't have yet.
 * A real stretch goal if picoos ever grows actual isolated processes,
 * not something to build speculatively now.
